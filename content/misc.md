[wɪl mɛɹl] ±ɛ/æ distinction

I like dead languages. I'm decent at Latin, Old Norse, and Old English.
<!-- Strangely enough, I took a class where we learned Proto Indo European. -->
I've also dabbled in Middle Egyptian, and considering studying Nahuatl.

I'm a big proponent of the urban walk. People in Seattle seem to prefer hiking, which is fun too I guess?

I play pick-up basketball. I also play and have (amateurly) made video games. Check out my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/snorridevteam) from when I was 15 ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Here's some random stuff that I've written over the years, in no particular order.

* [Origin of the Navajo code talkers](/files/NavajoCodeTalkers.pdf)
* [*Jórsalafari*](/files/Jorsalafari.pdf): the Norwegian Crusade as a viking expedition
* [The history of Minecraft](https://www.packerintersections.com/the-history-of-minecraft-how-a-swedish-indie-game-came-to-dominate-the-world.html): how a Swedish indie game came to dominate the world
* [Dante++](/files/dantepp.pdf): A chapter extending *Inferno* to the age of Big Data™ and AI

*There's other stuff on my [blog](/post/).
