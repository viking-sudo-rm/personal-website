<p>I am a researcher advised by <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/">Noah Smith</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~yoavg/uni/">Yoav Goldberg</a>, and <a href="https://roys174.github.io//">Roy Schwartz</a> on the <a href="https://allennlp.org/">AllenNLP</a> team at <a href="https://allenai.org/">AI2</a>. I recently graduated from Yale, where I worked with <a href="http://clay.yale.edu/">CLAY</a> and my <a href="/publication/sequential-neural-networks-as-automata/">thesis</a> was advised by <a href="https://bobfrank1.github.io/">Bob Frank</a> and <a href="https://cpsc.yale.edu/people/dana-angluin">Dana Angluin</a>.</p>

<p>My research interests lie at the intersection of language and computationâ€”spanning NLP, linguistics, and formal language theory. In particular, my recent work has developed theory for understanding NLP deep learning models. I am interested in how AI systems represent the compositional structure and meaning of language, and how we can improve current representations to enable deeper language understanding.</p>
