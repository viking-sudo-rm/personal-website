Hi, I'm [wɪl mɛɹəl]. I'm originally from NYC, but I moved to Seattle in September, 2019.
<!-- ±ɛ/æ distinction -->

If I wasn't doing NLP, I'd probably be studying medieval history and dead languages, particularly Latin, Old Norse, and Old English.
<!-- Strangely enough, I took a class where we learned Proto Indo European. -->
I've also dabbled in Middle Egyptian, and am considering studying Nahuatl. See some translations from these languages on my [blog](/post/).

I'm a big proponent of the urban walk. Seattle seems to prefer hiking, which I'm also down with, especially to locations of [historical interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Rock_Ridge).

I play pick-up basketball and the classic video game Age of Empires II ([~2.2k team ELO](https://ratings.aoe2.se/?team_one=802126&team_two=)). I have also done some amateur game development, and used to have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/snorridevteam) when I was 15 ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.

Other facts about me:

* I am a definitively average cook, but (thanks to my grandma) I can make [pierogi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierogi) from scratch.
* I used to compete in table tennis. I also used to play baseball in high school.

Here's some random stuff that I've written over the years, in no particular order.

* [Origin of the Navajo code talkers](/files/NavajoCodeTalkers.pdf)
* [*Jórsalafari*](/files/Jorsalafari.pdf): the Norwegian Crusade as a viking expedition
* [The history of Minecraft](https://www.packerintersections.com/the-history-of-minecraft-how-a-swedish-indie-game-came-to-dominate-the-world.html): how a Swedish indie game came to dominate the world
* [Dante++](/files/dantepp.pdf): A chapter extending *Inferno* to the age of Big Data™ and AI
* [Northern Origins](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MxN3SAVeEb2sY-aI7JCxa2hhaGBNwgdgISVEotdPWG0/edit?usp=sharing): Chapter 1 of an epic that I started as a COVID-19 creative writing project

*There's more writing on my [blog](/post/).
