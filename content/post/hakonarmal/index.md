*Hákonarmál* is a skaldic poem composed by Eyvindr skáldaspillir that recounts the arrival of King Hákon in Valhalla after death. Raised in the court of King Æþelstan in Anglo-Saxon England, Hákon was the first king of Norway who tried to introduce Christianity to the heathen country. Later in life, however, he renounced his Christian faith and returned to the ways of the Norse gods. This move won him respect in the eyes of skaldic poets, and also, according to Eyvindr, a place alongside Odin in Valhalla.

Luckily, the poem has been preserved fully, and it is widely considered to be one of the most beautiful surviving works of skaldic poetry. So now sit back, and I hope you enjoy my translation!

## Translation

Gondul and Skogul 
were sent by Gautatyr
to choose from kings 
who of the Ynglings 
should walk with Odin 
and be in Valhalla. <!-- Don't like literal "be" here. -->

They found Björn's brother 
putting on his mail, 
the honorable king 
stationed under his flag. 
With arrows aflight, 
Spears locked and lowered, 
Then was the battle started up. 


The leader of the Northmen, 
that slayer of jarls, 
had called heroes of Halogaland
and Horthaland as well, 
before battle broke out.
